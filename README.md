# JS30 Array Cardio Day2
Excorcise 07 in WesBos' JavaScript30 tutorials. 

Day 01 methods were for the most part methods I am familiar with from my boot camp. Day 02 methods I have not come across yet, but were fairly self explanatory. This was a nice pace after day 06 Type Ahead which I found to be quite challenging to get my code working for my bonus piece.

Especially as a junior dev fresh out of boot camp with no CS degree I feel I must always do something extra or a "bonus piece" if you will to help stand out among other applicants. For the bonus piece not listed in the tutorial I chose to strengthen day 01 knowledge and see how else I could modify the comments array without mutating the original. I used Filter().
